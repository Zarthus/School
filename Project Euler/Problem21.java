	 * Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than
	 * n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b,
	 * then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable
	 * numbers.
	 * 
	 * For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
	 * 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
